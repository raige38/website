# Portfolio Website with a Fun Cat Fact App

I created this website during my second year as an apprentice to gain experience with React and the Chakra UI framework. It features a portfolio of my projects and a fun little Cat Fact app that I developed using these technologies, along with a third-party API for the cat facts.

The website was originally deployed on Heroku under the domain raige.ch. However, due to the expiration of my Heroku free trial, the website is currently offline.

I am continuously working on improving my skills and expanding my portfolio, so stay tuned for more updates and projects in the future. Thank you for your interest in my work!
